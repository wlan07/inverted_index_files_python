Text indexing
Text indexing is a preprocessing step for text retrieval. During the text indexing process, texts are collected, parsed and stored to facilitate fast and accurate text retrieval. Text retrieval (also called document retrieval) is a branch of information retrieval in which the information is stored primarily in the form of text. Text retrieval is defined as the matching of some stated user query against a set of texts. As the result of text retrieval, texts are ranked and presented to the user according to their relevance with user query. User queries can range from a few words to multi-sentence full descriptions, which represent the users information need.
